These basis sets contains the following components:

Alanine, Aspartate, Choline (Cho), Glycerophosphochoine (GPC), Phosphocholine (PC), Creatine (Cr), Phosphocreatine (PCr), GABA, Glutamate (Glu), Glutamine (Gln), Lactate, Myo-Inisitol, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), n-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), Scyllo-Inositol, Glutathione (GSH), Glucose, Taurine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, Cit, Eth, Glycine, PE. 

Additionally, Siemens_3T_press_20_MM also includes nine macromolecules (M0.95, M1.24, M1.43, M1.71, M2.07, M2.30, M3.03, M3.24, M3.98) simulated as detailed in Bell et al. (2024) under review (details and spin systems can be found in https://github.com/HarrisBrainLab/MMSim).

The components of these basis set were simulated using the FID-A script run_simPressShaped_fast with the parameters detailed below.
