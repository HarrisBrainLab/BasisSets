These basis set contains the following components:

Alanine, Aspartate, Choline (Cho), Glycerophosphochoine (GPC), Phosphocholine (PC), Creatine (Cr), Phosphocreatine (PCr), GABA, Glutamate (Glu), Glutamine (Gln), Lactate, Myo-Inisitol, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), n-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), Scyllo-Inositol, Glutathione (GSH), Glucose, Taurine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, Cit, Eth, Glycine, PE. 

Additionally, Siemens_7T_steam8_MM also includes nine macromolecules (M0.95, M1.24, M1.43, M1.71, M2.07, M2.30, M3.03, M3.24, M3.98) simulated as detailed in Bell et al. (2024) under review (details and spin systems can be found in https://github.com/HarrisBrainLab/MMSim).

The components of these basis set were simulated using the FID-A script run_simSemiLASERShaped_fast with the parameters detailed below.
